To mix the dough: Mix all of the ingredients together, using the smaller amount of flour. Mix thoroughly until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl, adding more of the flour if necessary. Turn the dough out onto a floured surface to knead. (This may be a little messy, but don't give up!)\n2. To knead the dough by hand: Fold the far edge of the dough back over on itself towards you. Press into the dough with the heels of your hands and push away. After each push, rotate the dough 90°. Repeat this process in a rhythmic, rocking motion for 5 minutes, sprinkling only enough flour on your kneading surface to prevent sticking. Let the dough rest while you scrape out and grease the mixing bowl. Knead the dough again for 2 to 3 minutes.\n3. To knead the dough using a stand mixer: Mix all of the ingredients together using your mixer's dough hook. You'll want to reduce the amount of water to 1 3/4 cups, since you won't be using any extra flour on a kneading surface, as you do when kneading by hand. Knead the dough at low-medium speed for about 10 minutes total, until it's smooth and just barely sticking to the bottom and/or sides of the bowl.\n4. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl large enough for it to at least double in size. Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm, draft-free place (your turned-off oven works well) until the dough doubles, about 1 to 2 hours.\n5. To shape the dough: Gently deflate the dough. Cut it in half and shape into two oval Italian- or longer, thinner French-style loaves. Place the loaves on a baking sheet lined with parchment (if you have it) and generously sprinkled with cornmeal or semolina. The cornmeal or semolina are optional, but give the bottom crust lovely crunch. \n6. Let the loaves rise, gently covered in greased plastic wrap, for 45 minutes, until they're noticeably puffy. Toward the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 425°F.\n7. To bake the bread: Brush or spray the loaves generously with lukewarm water; this step, which helps keep the top crust pliant while baking, will enhance the bread's rise. Lightly slash the tops of the loaves three or more times diagonally. Place the pan on the middle rack of the oven.\n8. Bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and sounds hollow to the touch. The interior temperature of the bread should register at least 200°F on a digital thermometer.\n8. Remove the loaves from the oven, take them off the pan, and return them to the oven, placing them right on the rack. Turn the oven off and crack the door open several inches. Let the loaves cool in the cooling oven; this will make them extra-crusty.\n10. Store completely cool bread in a paper bag at room temperature for a couple of days. For longer storage, wrap well and freeze.","attemptHistory":[{"dateTime":[2020,4,4,11,59,13,933000000],"resultNotes":"Crumb: \nCrust: \nFlavor: \nOther notes: \n","photoPath":"C:\\Users\\Thomas Cowan\\IdeaProjects\\CPSC210\\assignments\\project_q4v2b\\data\\images\\attemptphotos\\NoKneadNYT.png"},{"dateTime":[2020,4,4,11,59,19,648000000],"resultNotes":"Crumb: \nCrust: \nFlavor: \nOther notes: \n","photoPath":"C:\\Users\\Thomas Cowan\\IdeaProjects\\CPSC210\\assignments\\project_q4v2b\\data\\images\\attemptphotos\\hearthLoaf25.png"},{"dateTime":[2020,4,4,11,59,45,456000000],"resultNotes":"Crumb: \nCrust: \nFlavor: \nOther notes: \n","photoPath":"C:\\Users\\Thomas Cowan\\IdeaProjects\\CPSC210\\assignments\\project_q4v2b\\data\\images\\attemptphotos\\hearthLoaf2.png"}],"cookTime":35,"prepTime":155,"cookTemp":425,"flourFraction":1.0,"saltFraction":0.02,"sugarFraction":0.02,"fatFraction":0.0,"yeastFraction":0.01,"yield":1.7300000000000002,"doughWeight":1000,"cookingVessel":"pan"},"branchLabel":"master","sha1":"ae6890c92d3f75cbe1ba41e42e73671308d0a6fa","parents":[]},"currentBranch":"master","mostRecentNodesByBranch":{"master":{"recipeVersion":"ab3f04a5-6671-48dd-b9a1-113b226e2663","branchLabel":"master","sha1":"ae6890c92d3f75cbe1ba41e42e73671308d0a6fa","parents":[]}},"attempts":[{"dateTime":[2020,4,4,11,59,45,456000000],"resultNotes":"Crumb: \nCrust: \nFlavor: \nOther notes: \n","photoPath":"C:\\Users\\Thomas Cowan\\IdeaProjects\\CPSC210\\assignments\\project_q4v2b\\data\\images\\attemptphotos\\hearthLoaf2.png"},{"dateTime":[2020,4,4,11,59,19,648000000],"resultNotes":"Crumb: \nCrust: \nFlavor: \nOther notes: \n","photoPath":"C:\\Users\\Thomas Cowan\\IdeaProjects\\CPSC210\\assignments\\project_q4v2b\\data\\images\\attemptphotos\\hearthLoaf25.png"},{"dateTime":[2020,4,4,11,59,13,933000000],"resultNotes":"Crumb: \nCrust: \nFlavor: \nOther notes: \n","photoPath":"C:\\Users\\Thomas Cowan\\IdeaProjects\\CPSC210\\assignments\\project_q4v2b\\data\\images\\attemptphotos\\NoKneadNYT.png"}]},"No-Knead Focaccia BA":{"activeNode":{"recipeVersion":{"className":"model.BreadRecipe","id":"3cb65336-5339-4e1c-bfe5-f06fffce03d5","waterFraction":0.95,"ingredientList":[{"type":"flour","weight":453},{"type":"water","weight":430},{"type":"salt","weight":13},{"type":"fat","weight":57},{"type":"sugar","weight":25},{"type":"yeast","weight":19}],"instructions":"1. Whisk 1¼-oz. envelope active dry yeast (about 2¼ tsp.), 2 tsp. honey, and 2½ cups lukewarm water in a medium bowl and let sit 5 minutes (it should foam or at least get creamy; if it doesn’t your yeast is dead and you should start again—check the expiration date!).\n2. Add 5 cups (625 g) all-purpose flour and 5 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 1 Tbsp. Morton kosher salt and mix with a rubber spatula until a shaggy dough forms and no dry streaks remain.\n3. Pour 4 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil into a big bowl that will fit in your refrigerator. This puppy is going to rise! Transfer dough to bowl and turn to coat in oil. Cover with a silicone lid or plastic wrap and chill until dough is doubled in size (it should look very bubbly and alive), at least 8 hours and up to 1 day. If you're in a rush, you can also let it rise at room temperature until doubled in size, 3–4 hours.\n4. Generously butter a 13x9\" baking pan, for thicker focaccia that’s perfect for sandwiches, or an 18x13\" rimmed baking sheet, for focaccia that's thinner, crispier, and great for snacking. The butter may seem superfluous, but it’ll ensure that your focaccia doesn’t stick. Pour 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil into center of pan. Keeping the dough in the bowl and using a fork in each hand, gather up edges of dough farthest from you and lift up and over into center of bowl. Give the bowl a quarter turn and repeat process. Do this 2 more times; you want to deflate dough while you form it into a rough ball. (We learned this technique from Alexandra Stafford, who uses it to shape her no-knead bread.) Transfer dough to prepared pan. Pour any oil left in bowl over and turn dough to coat it in oil. Let rise, uncovered, in a dry, warm spot (like near a radiator or on top of the fridge or a preheating oven) until doubled in size, at least 1½ hours and up to 4 hours.\n5. Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 450°. To see if the dough is ready, poke it with your finger. It should spring back slowly, leaving a small visible indentation. If it springs back quickly, the dough isn’t ready. (If at this point the dough is ready to bake but you aren’t, you can chill it up to 1 hour.) Lightly oil your hands. If using a rimmed baking sheet, gently stretch out dough to fill (you probably won't need to do this if using a baking pan). Dimple focaccia all over with your fingers, like you’re aggressively playing the piano, creating very deep depressions in the dough (reach your fingers all the way to the bottom of the pan). Drizzle with remaining 1 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkle with flaky sea salt. Bake focaccia until puffed and golden brown all over, 20–30 minutes.\n6. Hold off on this last step until you're ready to serve the focaccia: Melt 4 Tbsp. unsalted butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. Remove from heat. Peel and grate in 2–4 garlic cloves with a Microplane (use 2 cloves if you’re garlic-shy or up to 4 if you love it). Return to medium heat and cook, stirring often, until garlic is just lightly toasted, 30–45 seconds. (Or, if you prefer raw garlic to toasted garlic, you can grate the garlic into the hot butter, off heat, then brush right away.)\n7. Brush garlic-butter all over focaccia and slice into squares or rectangles.","attemptHistory":[{"dateTime":[2020,4,4,12,0,1,190000000],"resultNotes":"Crumb: \nCrust: \nFlavor: \nOther notes: \n","photoPath":"C:\\Users\\Thomas Cowan\\IdeaProjects\\CPSC210\\assignments\\project_q4v2b\\data\\images\\attemptphotos\\Focaccia2.png"},{"dateTime":[2020,4,4,12,0,12,34000000],"resultNotes":"Crumb: \nCrust: \nFlavor: \nOther notes: \n","photoPath":"C:\\Users\\Thomas Cowan\\IdeaProjects\\CPSC210\\assignments\\project_q4v2b\\data\\images\\attemptphotos\\foccacia.png"}],"cookTime":25,"prepTime":600,"cookTemp":450,"flourFraction":1.0,"saltFraction":0.03,"sugarFraction":0.055999999999999994,"fatFraction":0.128,"yeastFraction":0.043,"yield":2.2070000000000003,"doughWeight":1000,"cookingVessel":"pan"},"branchLabel":"master","sha1":"456eeccf853094620ebc0435836ae7bf4926be6d","parents":[]},"currentBranch":"master","mostRecentNodesByBranch":{"master":{"recipeVersion":"3cb65336-5339-4e1c-bfe5-f06fffce03d5","branchLabel":"master","sha1":"456eeccf853094620ebc0435836ae7bf4926be6d","parents":[]}},"attempts":[{"dateTime":[2020,4,4,12,0,12,34000000],"resultNotes":"Crumb: \nCrust: \nFlavor: \nOther notes: \n","photoPath":"C:\\Users\\Thomas Cowan\\IdeaProjects\\CPSC210\\assignments\\project_q4v2b\\data\\images\\attemptphotos\\foccacia.png"},{"dateTime":[2020,4,4,12,0,1,190000000],"resultNotes":"Crumb: \nCrust: \nFlavor: \nOther notes: \n","photoPath":"C:\\Users\\Thomas Cowan\\IdeaProjects\\CPSC210\\assignments\\project_q4v2b\\data\\images\\attemptphotos\\Focaccia2.png"}]},"No-Knead Bread NYT":{"activeNode":{"recipeVersion":{"className":"model.BreadRecipe","id":"dbee2743-c130-46ee-b414-d3ea0559a4be","waterFraction":1.0,"ingredientList":[{"type":"flour","weight":350},{"type":"water","weight":350},{"type":"salt","weight":7},{"type":"fat","weight":0},{"type":"sugar","weight":0},{"type":"yeast","weight":1}],"instructions":"1.

Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to work surface or to your fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into a ball. Generously coat a cotton towel (not terry cloth) with flour, wheat bran or cornmeal; put dough seam side down on towel and dust with more flour, bran or cornmeal. Cover with another cotton towel and let rise for about 2 hours. When it is ready, dough will be more than double in size and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.\n    4. At least a half-hour before dough is ready, heat oven to 450 degrees. Put a 6- to 8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron, enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as it heats. When dough is ready, carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand under towel and turn dough over into pot, seam side up; it may look like a mess, but that is O.K. Shake pan once or twice if dough is unevenly distributed; it will straighten out as it bakes.

Scrape the dough and any dry bits out onto the counter and knead the dry ingredients into the dough. (Note: The dough will be very firm. Use your body weight to knead the dough.)\n4. Knead the dough for 8-10 minutes or until smooth.\n5. Form the dough into a tight round.\n6. Roll and shape the dough into a 12-inch log (30 cm) and cut the dough into 12 equal sized pieces weighing approximately 115 grams.\n7. Form each piece of dough into a tight round and cover with plastic wrap. Rest the rounded pieces of dough for 5 minutes.\n8.

The flour/liquid ratio is important in this recipe, so measure carefully. Your best bet is to weigh the flour; or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.\n2. Combine all of the ingredients in a large mixing bowl, or a large (6-quart), food-safe plastic bucket. For first-timers, \"lukewarm\" means about 105°F, but don't stress over getting the temperatures exact here. Comfortably warm is fine; \"OUCH, that's hot!\" is not. Yeast is a living thing; treat it nicely.\n3. Mix and stir everything together to make a very sticky, rough dough. If you have a stand mixer, beat at medium speed with the beater blade for 30 to 60 seconds. If you don't have a mixer, just stir-stir-stir with a big spoon or dough whisk until everything is combined.\n4. Next, you're going to let the dough rise. If you've made the dough in a plastic bucket, you're all set — just let it stay there, covering the bucket with a lid or plastic wrap; a shower cap actually works well here. If you've made the dough in a bowl that's not at least 6-quart capacity, transfer it to a large bowl; it's going to rise a lot. There's no need to grease the bowl, though you can if you like; it makes it a bit easier to get the dough out when it's time to bake bread.\n5. Cover the bowl or bucket, and let the dough rise at room temperature for 2 hours. Then refrigerate it for at least 2 hours, or for up to about 7 days. (If you're pressed for time, skip the room-temperature rise, and stick it right into the fridge). The longer you keep it in the fridge, the tangier it'll get; if you chill it for 7 days, it will taste like sourdough. Over the course of the first day or so, it'll rise, then fall. That's OK; that's what it's supposed to do.\n6. When you're ready to make bread, sprinkle the top of the dough with flour; this will make it easier to grab a hunk. Grease your hands, and pull off about 1/4 to 1/3 of the dough — a 14-ounce to 19-ounce piece, if you have a scale. It'll be about the size of a softball, or a large grapefruit.\n7. Plop the sticky dough onto a floured work surface, and round it into a ball, or a longer log. Don't fuss around trying to make it perfect; just do the best you can.\n8. Place the loaf on a piece of parchment (if you're going to use a baking stone); or onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Sift a light coating of flour over the top; this will help keep the bread moist as it rests before baking.\n9. Let the loaf warm to room temperature and rise; this should take about 60 minutes (or longer, up to a couple of hours, if your house is cool). It won't appear to rise upwards that much; rather, it'll seem to settle and expand. Preheat your oven to 450°F while the loaf rests. If you're using a baking stone, position it on a middle rack while the oven preheats. Place a shallow metal or cast iron pan (not glass, Pyrex, or ceramic) on the lowest oven rack, and have 1 cup of hot water ready to go.\n10. When you're ready to bake, take a sharp knife and slash the bread 2 or 3 times, making a cut about 1/2\" deep. The bread may deflate a bit; that's OK, it'll pick right up in the hot oven.\n11. Place the bread in the oven — onto the baking stone, if you're using one, or simply onto a middle rack, if it's on a pan — and carefully pour the 1 cup hot water into the shallow pan on the rack beneath. It'll bubble and steam; close the oven door quickly.\n12. Bake the bread for 25 to 35 minutes, until it's a deep, golden brown.\n13. Remove the bread from the oven, and cool it on a rack. Store leftover bread in a plastic bag at room temperature.","attemptHistory":[{"dateTime":[2020,4,4,12,1,31,902000000],"resultNotes":"Crumb: \nCrust: \nFlavor: \nOther notes: \n","photoPath":"C:\\Users\\Thomas Cowan\\IdeaProjects\\CPSC210\\assignments\\project_q4v2b\\data\\images\\attemptphotos\\sourdough2.png"}],"cookTime":35,"prepTime":275,"cookTemp":450,"flourFraction":1.0,"saltFraction":0.02,"sugarFraction":0.0,"fatFraction":0.0,"yeastFraction":0.015,"yield":1.785,"doughWeight":1000,"cookingVessel":"pan"},"branchLabel":"master","sha1":"f469bfaf631edc7dd00479e41b2882b8c2d8ab05","parents":[]},{"recipeVersion":{"className":"model.BreadRecipe","id":"1c50a896-4cc3-4d1d-8765-9a4b80d0bfa3","waterFraction":0.68,"ingredientList":[{"type":"flour","weight":583},{"type":"water","weight":396},{"type":"salt","weight":11},{"type":"fat","weight":0},{"type":"sugar","weight":0},{"type":"yeast","weight":8}],"instructions":"1.
