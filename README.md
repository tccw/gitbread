## Version control for baking (bread)

GitBread is a baking and recipe diary. It allows bakers to create or copy bread recipes 
to their recipe book, add notes, make modifications, and create new or improved recipes 
by recording variations in ingredients, cook times, cooking vessels and more. 

The GitBread concept of recipe version control is based on [git](https://git-scm.com/),
a version control system for tracking changes in source code during software development.

GitBread allows for things like:
- Recording recipes
- *branch* recipes to test variations
- *merge* changes back into your main recipe for when your changes improve the recipe
- *fork* the recipe in order to create an entirely new recipe based on a previous recipe
- Automatically record the weather for the day you made your bread
- Common bakers percentage calculations including support for preferments, poolish, hydration adjustments for milk and eggs, etc. 
- Record process notes like your kneading method, if you rested the dough, number and length of rises, autolyse, etc.

**something about how this will allow the user to do all their experimentation and record final recipes in the same place**
